    <h3>How To Tell If Your Dog Is At A Healthy Weight</h3>
    <p>For dogs to lead an active, healthy life it is important for them to maintain a healthy body weight, 
        and as a dog owner it is your responsibility to ensure that they do so. 
        The most important factors to consider when it comes to your pet's weight are the intensity with which it exercises,
         how often it gets to do so, and, of course, its daily food intake.
        The results of in-depth study carried out by Purina Pet Food and professional animal nutritionists in
         2002 showed that by eating a properly regulated diet, dogs can live almost two years longer; which is quite 
         a difference considering that the average lifespan of a dog is between ten and thirteen years. 
         There are clear benefits to maintaining your dog's weight at a healthy level, but how do you know if your dog is at the correct weight?
        If you are concerned your dog is underweight or overweight, you can get an accurate answer to this question by visiting a vet or pet nutritionist, 
        but there are a few simple ways of finding out for yourself if your dog requires a lifestyle change.
